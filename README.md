# RoHe

The code of paper ”Robust Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks against Adversarial Attacks“ (AAAI2022).

Here we show the attack process in "attack_HAN.ipynb and attack_HAN_RoHe.ipynb". 

To clearly compare the robustness of HAN and our HAN-RoHe, we also provide their visualizations in Figure attack_HAN.png and attack_HAN_RoHe.png.
*For simplicity, in the code we take 100 target nodes as example, which can be change to 500 in codes.


# Usage
Run attack_HAN.ipynb and attack_HAN_RoHe.ipynb


# Requirements
-torch 1.3.1

-dgl

-deeprobust

-sklearn




More details will be published soon (^▽^)
