Descrition:
-Here we provide part of codes and datasets for clarity. 
-Then we show the attack process in "attack_HAN.ipynb and attack_HAN_RoHe.ipynb". 
-To clearly compare the robustness of HAN and our HAN-RoHe, we also provide their visualizations in Figure attack_HAN.png and attack_HAN_RoHe.png.
*For simplicity, in the code we take 100 target nodes as example, which can be change to 500 in codes.

Usage:
-run attack_HAN.ipynb and attack_HAN_RoHe.ipynb

Requirements:
-torch 1.3.1
-dgl
-deeprobust
-sklearn
